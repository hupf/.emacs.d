;;; initializer-system.el --- System level tuning
;;;
;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; Some stuff is not really anything to do with editing or modifying
;;; code, but related to the performance of Emacs itself, or where it
;;; can find executables in the operating system, or how something will
;;; behave on a Mac vs a Linux or Windows box.  Those types of tweaks go
;;; here.
;;;
;;; This is ported from Prelude.

;;; Code:

;; reduce the frequency of garbage collection by making it happen on
;; each 100MB of allocated data (the default is on every 0.76MB)
(setq gc-cons-threshold 100000000)

;; Increase the amount of data which Emacs reads from a process
;; (useful for LSP)
(setq read-process-output-max (* 1024 1024)) ;; 1mb

;; warn when opening files bigger than 100MB
(setq large-file-warning-threshold 100000000)

;; disable the toolbar at the top of the window
(when (fboundp 'tool-bar-mode)
  (tool-bar-mode -1))

;; When launching Emacs from GUI: determine `exec-path' & environment
;; variables by starting an actual shell session
(use-package exec-path-from-shell
  :custom
  ;; Environment variables to be copied from the shell
  (exec-path-from-shell-variables '("PATH" "MANPATH" "GEM_PATH" "GOROOT"))

  ;; Since starting a shell session is quite time consuming
  ;; (`exec-path-from-shell-initialize' slows down Emacs startup by a
  ;; few seconds), call the custom
  ;; `exec-path-from-shell-initialize-maybe' function below, before
  ;; executing something that relies on it...
  ;; :config (exec-path-from-shell-initialize)
  )

(setq exec-path-from-shell--initialized-p nil)
