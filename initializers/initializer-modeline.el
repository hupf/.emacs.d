;; TODO
;; ;;; initializer-modeline.el --- Setup our modeline.
;; ;;;
;; ;;; Commentary:
;; ;;;
;; ;;; The default Emacs modeline is lame to the point of not providing any useful
;; ;;; information in a sufficiently customized Emacs. The goal is to make our
;; ;;; modeline useful and beautiful (in that order)
;; ;;;
;; ;;; Code:

;; (require 'diminish)

;; ;; Out of the box, Every single major and minor mode gets put onto the modeline
;; ;; which clutters it up terribly. Using diminish we can hide or abbreviate modes
;; ;; that don't contribute meaningfully to the high-level context.
;; ;; see https://github.com/myrjola/diminish.el
