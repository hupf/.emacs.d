;; ;; -- Ivy setup --
;; ;; https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper
;; ;; Ivy has a lot of different moving parts which can be unecessarily
;; ;; confusing. There is (i think) Ivy, the completion system which is
;; ;; just the low-level set of apis for turning text into a set of
;; ;; matches. Then there is Swiper, the UI that interacts with matching
;; ;; in the mini-buffer. And then finally, Counsel, which provides and
;; ;; extends a bunch of core emacs commands. So Ivy, Swiper and Counsel,
;; ;; are all packages that are part of the same system, so we'll refer
;; ;; to them as Ivy from here on out, even though it might technically
;; ;; refer to a sub-part.

;; ;; Ivy will use flx for fuzzy matching and sorting if it's installed.
;; (require 'flx)

;; ;; Ivy will use smex for the counsel-M-x (it's replacement for M-x) if
;; ;; it is installed.
;; (require 'smex)

;; ;; use Ivy mode for completion
;; (ivy-mode 1)
;; (setq projectile-completion-system 'ivy)
;; (counsel-projectile-mode)

;; ;; Make the default completion mechanism a fuzzy search. However, you
;; ;; don't really want to use fuzzy matching on lists that have content
;; ;; with a lot of spaces (like documents), so disable for swiper.
